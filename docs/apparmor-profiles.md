# AppArmor profile modes

AppArmor profile modes determine how applications interact with system resources. You can mix enforce mode profiles and complain mode profiles in your server. 

| Mode       | Description                                                                                                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enforce    | Restricts MySQL processes according to the rules defined in the profile. Any action violating these rules is denied.     |
| Complain   | Allows MySQL processes to take restricted actions, but logs these actions for review.                                    |
| Disabled   | Turns off profile restrictions entirely, allowing MySQL processes to take any action without logging.                   |

Understanding these modes helps MySQL developers ensure that their applications can access necessary resources while maintaining system security.

## Benefits

| Benefit           | Description                                                                                                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhanced Security | AppArmor profile modes, such as Enforce and Complain, help enforce security policies to prevent unauthorized access. |
| Easy Troubleshooting | Profile modes provide flexibility in troubleshooting access issues by allowing developers to switch between modes. |

### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage       | Description                                                                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Limited Flexibility | Profile modes may restrict certain actions or access, potentially limiting the functionality of MySQL applications.    |
| Complexity          | Understanding and managing different profile modes can be complex for beginner developers, leading to errors.        |
| Debugging Challenges | Troubleshooting issues related to profile modes, such as DENIED entries in logs, may require additional expertise.   |
