## Release highlights

Percona has removed an Oracle patch for `mysqldump` that performed, at the beginning of the dump, a `FLUSH_TABLES_WITH_READ_LOCK` to get consistent `GTID_EXECUTED` because the patch required additional user privileges, even when the user does not use GTID-based replication. The following bugs based on this patch were submitted to Oracle:

* [MySQL 109701](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=1097010)

* [MySQL 109685](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=109685)
  
The Percona solution uses `START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT`.

Improvements and bug fixes provided by Oracle for MySQL 5.7.41 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* Updated the linked OpenSSL library for MySQL Server to 1.1.s
  
* Updated the bundled zlib library to zlib 1.2.13. This zlib library version is the minimum supported.

* While the SQL thread handled a transaction, issuing `STOP SLAVE_SQL_THREAD` caused replication to stop immediately instead of waiting for the event group to complete before the shutdown.

## Bug fixes

* [PS-7538](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-7538): With `innodb_optimize_fulltext_only` enabled, running `OPTIMIZE TABLE` on a table with an FTS index caused a server exit.
