## Bug fixes

* [PS-7806]: Working with tables with column compression broke asynchronous replication. Using column compression on the tables reduces the storage space and the memory usage of the data but also increases the CPU overhead and complexity. Asynchronous replication sends data from one node to another without waiting for acknowledgment, which improves performance and source availability but also risks data loss and inconsistency. With column compression, the replica must decompress the data in the columns, which can cause errors, delays, or conflicts.

* [PS-8879]: A large table received an out-of-memory error when running `ALTER TABLE ... COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED;` because the internal DDL copy operation consumed the available memory (thank you to minghuan zhao for your contribution).
