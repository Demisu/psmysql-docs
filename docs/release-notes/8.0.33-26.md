# Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.33-26 (2023-)

[Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.33-26](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) includes all the features and bug fixes available in the
[MySQL 8.0.33 Community Edition](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-33.html) in addition to enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.

Percona Server for MySQL is a freely available, fully compatible, enhanced, and open source drop-in replacement for any MySQL database. It provides superior and optimized performance, greater scalability, and availability, enhanced backups, increased visibility and instrumentation.

Percona Server for MySQL is trusted by thousands of enterprises to provide better performance and concurrency for their most demanding workloads.

## Release highlights

* Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.33-26 implements the [Audit Log Filter plugin](../audit-log-filter-overview.md) that allows you to monitor, log, and block a connection or query actively executed on the selected server. 

* Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.33-26 implements the [data masking component](../data-masking-comparison.md). The data masking component extends the server's functionality and supports more arguments to the `gen_rnd_email()` function than the data masking plugin.

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.33 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* The `INSTALL COMPONENT` includes the `SET` clause. The `SET` clause sets the values of component system variables when installing one or several components. This reduces the inconvenience and limitations associated with assigning variable values in other ways.

* The mysqlbinlog `--start-position` accepts values up to `18446744073709551615`. If the `--read-from-remote-server` or `--read-from-remote-source` option is used, the maximum is `4294967295`. (Bug #77818, Bug #21498994)

* Using a generated column with `DEFAULT(col_name)` to specify the default value for a named column is not allowed and throws an error message. (Bug #34463652, Bug #34369580)

* Not all possible error states were reported during the binary log recovery process. (Bug #33658850)

* User-defined collations are deprecated. The usage of the following user-defined collations causes a warning that is written to the log:

  * When `COLLATE` is followed by the name of a user-defined collation in an SQL statement.

  * When the name of a user-defined collation is used as the value of `collation_server`, `collation_database`, or `collation_connection`.

The support for user-defined collations will be removed in a future releases of MySQL.
