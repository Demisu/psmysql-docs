# Reserved keywords

Percona uses reserved keywords, which define or manipulate a function or feature of the database. Add these words to the [MySQL reserved keyword list] when using Percona Server for MySQL.

If you must use a reserved keyword as an identifier, enclose the word in a set of backtick (`) symbols.

The following is a list of Percona-specific reserved keywords:

* CLIENT_STATISTICS
* CLUSTERING
* COMPRESSION_DICTIONARY
* EFFECTIVE
* INDEX_STATISTICS
* SEQUENCE_TABLE
* TABLE_STATISTICS
* THREAD_STATISTICS
* USER_STATISTICS
