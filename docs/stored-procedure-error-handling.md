# Error handling in stored procedures

Error handling in stored procedures allows developers to gracefully handle exceptions and errors that may occur during the execution of the procedure. It enables better control over error messages and the ability to perform custom actions in response to errors.

## Advantages of Using Error Handling:

| Benefits   | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Graceful   | Error handling provides a way to handle exceptions gracefully, preventing unexpected termination of the procedure and providing users with meaningful error messages.               |
| Customized | Developers can customize error handling to perform specific actions based on the type of error encountered, such as logging errors, rolling back transactions, or retrying operations. |
| Control    | Error handling gives developers greater control over error propagation and recovery, allowing them to handle errors at different levels of granularity and complexity.               |
| Robustness | By implementing error handling, developers can make stored procedures more robust and resilient to unexpected conditions, enhancing the overall stability and reliability of the system. |

## Disadvantages of Using Error Handling:

| Disadvantages | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Complexity    | Error handling can introduce additional complexity to stored procedures, making them harder to understand, debug, and maintain, especially when dealing with nested error handling.    |
| Overhead      | Implementing error handling may add overhead in terms of code complexity and execution time, particularly for procedures with extensive error-checking logic or frequent error conditions. |
| Performance   | Error handling may impact performance, especially in scenarios where error-checking logic needs to be executed repeatedly or in tight loops, leading to increased CPU and resource utilization. |
| Dependency    | Error handling can create dependencies between stored procedures and error-handling routines, making it challenging to modify or refactor procedures without affecting error handling.      |

To add error handling to a stored procedure, developers can use constructs like `DECLARE`, `SIGNAL`, `RESIGNAL`, and `HANDLER` to declare variables, raise errors, and handle exceptions. Here's an example of error handling in a stored procedure:

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
mysql> DELIMITER //
mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE my_procedure()
    -> BEGIN
    ->     DECLARE exit handler for sqlexception
    ->     BEGIN
    ->         -- Handle SQL exceptions
    ->         ROLLBACK;
    ->         SELECT 'An error occurred: ' || SQLSTATE();
    ->     END;
    ->
    ->     -- Procedure logic here
    -> END //
mysql> DELIMITER ;
```

In this example, the `DECLARE` statement declares an exit handler for SQL exceptions. Inside the handler block, the procedure rolls back any changes made and returns a custom error message with the SQL state.

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
mysql> CALL my_procedure();
```

This command executes the stored procedure and triggers the error handling logic if an exception occurs during execution.
