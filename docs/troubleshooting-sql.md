# Troubleshoot SQL code

## Troubleshooting SQL Code

To troubleshoot SQL code, follow these steps:

| Action       | Description                                                                                                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Review Error Messages | Carefully read any error messages returned by the MySQL server. They often provide valuable clues about what went wrong.       |
| Check Syntax  | Verify that the SQL syntax is correct. A single typo or missing keyword can cause errors.                                      |
| Verify Table and Column Names | Ensure that table and column names are spelled correctly and match the actual names in the database.                        |
| Test in Isolation | Test each part of the SQL statement separately to identify which part is causing the issue.                                   |
| Use Logging Tools | Enable query logging or use debugging tools to track the execution of SQL queries and identify any issues.                   |
| Review Documentation | Consult the MySQL documentation to understand the correct usage of SQL statements and functions.                              |
| Seek Help | Don't hesitate to ask for help from more experienced developers or consult online forums and communities for assistance.       |

Troubleshooting SQL Code example:

Suppose you have the following SQL query that is not returning the expected results:

```text
SELECT * FORM users WHERE age = 30;
```

After reviewing the error message returned by MySQL, you notice a typo in the query. The keyword "FORM" should be "FROM". After correcting the typo, the query becomes:

```text
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 30;
```

Now, the query should execute successfully and return the desired results.
